				<h1>About Me</h1>
					<header id="main-head"> Hello my name is <span>Nick Wise</span>. I currently am a student at a fantastic challenging school called Epicodus. below is a little more about myself.</header>
						<well>
					  <p>In 2009 I started studying at ASU. The Majot I declared was Biomedicinal Chemisty. I soon realized that I didn't like the environment where I was learning. Each student was a number to a teacher and the help was minimal. I took a break from school for a year to work as a illustrator for a sign company. Later, I started studying Chinese Martial Arts to aid in a need for something tangeble. I have now be a practictioner of Tai Chi Chuan for 6 years and don't plan on stopping any time soon. </p>
						<p>I hope you enjoyed learning a little about me. Have a peaceful day</p>
						<p>I decided to go to Epicodus because I wanted to be surrounded by others who were passionate about the same thing I was. Similar to Martial arts it is a family or a unit that can come together for one cause. And to me that is what life is about.</p>
						</well>
